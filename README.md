# git_drunk
A Russian roulette style drinking game based on git blame.

If your name appears take a shot. This game is best served with a collaborative repo, or else you'll be black out drunk faster than you can type 'git push --force'.

For extra fun times:

```sh
$ git config --global alias.drunk !ruby <path_to_git_drunk.rb>
```
